## PingCastle Dashbords.  
To continue the use of Copilot, I have "converted" the Clasic ASP, to ASP.Net running on same webserver, just in another application.
  
Requires the PingCastle repports to be in seperate folders with dateformat like the "Create-Report.ps1" do that is used by my "Install - PingCastle webservice.ps1" script.
And ASPNET45 installed on the IIS server, the following can be used to install the required featuers.  
  
Install-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Net-Ext45, Web-Asp-Net45, Web-ISAPI-Ext, Web-ISAPI-Filter, NET-Framework-45-ASPNET  
  
Next update the web.config in the PingCastle directory created by the "Install - PingCastle webservice.ps1"  
    <handlers>  
      <!-- Allow ASP.NET handlers -->  
      <add name="ASPNetHandler" path="*.aspx" verb="*" type="System.Web.UI.PageHandlerFactory" modules="ManagedPipelineHandler" resourceType="Unspecified" />  
    </handlers>

#### License requirements.
Please note this is created in my spare time, I use PingCastle at work and have an Auditor license.
I recommend purchasing an enterprise license if you want more detailed reports.

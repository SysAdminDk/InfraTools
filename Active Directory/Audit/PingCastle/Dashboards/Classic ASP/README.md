## PingCastle Dashbords.  
It have been years since I last created any meningfull html or javascript, so this created with all the AI help I can get, ChatGpt and Copilot.
just to have a little fun with the data avalible, feel free to copy and modify.
  
Requires the PingCastle repports to be in seperate folders with dateformat like the "Create-Report.ps1" do that is used by my "Install - PingCastle webservice.ps1" script.
  

### Default.asp  
Combines the Calender and GraphJs into one page.  
takes a minute to load, the server needs to parse all the xml files.
